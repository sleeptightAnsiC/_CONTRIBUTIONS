# _CONTRIBUTIONS

This is a list of my contributions that are either outside of GitHub or somehow hidden. \
Currently, it only contains contributions to Unreal Engine as those were the easiest too keep track about.


### Disclaimer
I do not mention unsuccessful contributions here, like bugs that were never answered after submission.
It is hard to tell why those went without any response sometimes.
I even had a situation once where my submission was pasted into the public bugtracker but I got no feedback about it.
Also there are simply lots of things missing, I should've started creating this list way earlier...
